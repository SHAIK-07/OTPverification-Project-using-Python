    "\n",
    "1,user_email\n",
    "\n",
    "it will ask user to enter his email and stores in user_email variable\n",
    "ex:ABC@gmail.com\n",

    "2,generate_otp():\n",
    "\n",
    "This function generates a random 6-digit OTP (One-Time Password).\n",
    "ex:  \"123456\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3,send_otp_email(email, otp):\n",
    "\n",
    "This function sends the generated OTP to the provided email address.\n",
    "It uses the Gmail SMTP server for sending emails.\n",
    "It logs in to the sender Gmail account with the email \"xyz@gmail.com\" and the password \"*********\".\n",

    "\n",
    "This function prompts the user to enter the OTP they received via email. In our case, it would print a message asking the user to enter the OTP\n",
    "and this will store in user_input variable \n",

    "\n",
    "5,verify_otp(user_input, generated_otp):\n",
    "\n",
    "This function compares the OTP entered by the user (user_input) with the OTP generated earlier (generated_otp).\n",
    "If the OTP entered by the user matches the generated OTP, it returns True, indicating successful verification. Otherwise, it returns False.\n",

    "\n",
    "It catches any exceptions that may occur during the email sending process, such as network errors or authentication failures.\n",
    "If an exception occurs, it prints an error message containing details about the exception (str(e)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2,OTP Verification Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "It enters a loop that continues as long as the number of attempts (attempts) is less than the maximum allowed attempts (max_attempts).\n",
    "Within the loop, it prompts the user to enter the OTP received via email using the received_otp_entry() function.\n",
    "It then verifies the entered OTP using the verify_otp() function.\n",
    "If the OTP verification is successful, it prints a message indicating access is granted and breaks out of the loop.\n",
    "If the OTP verification fails, it increments the attempt counter (attempts) and prints a message indicating the number of attempts left.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Maximum Attempts Reached:\n",
    "\n",
    "After exiting the loop, it checks if the number of attempts (attempts) has reached the maximum allowed attempts (max_attempts).\n",
    "If the maximum attempts are reached, it prints a message indicating that access is denied.\n"
